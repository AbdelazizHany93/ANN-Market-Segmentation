# ANN-Market-Segmentation

Project Overview
This project involves developing a neural network model for market segmentation based on a variety of factors including demographics, behavior, and other relevant criteria. The process will begin with selecting a dataset, such as the Online Retail Dataset or the Bank Marketing Dataset, to explore and understand the customer data available. The initial phase will focus on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the data, examining how different features correlate with each other, and identifying any outliers or missing values that need to be addressed.
